# Number Guessing Game

This is a simple number guessing game where the computer randomly selects a number between 1 and 100, and the player has to guess it. The game provides hints like "too high" or "too low" to help the player guess the correct number.

## How to Play

1. Run the executable file or compile and run the C++ code provided (`number_guessing_game.cpp`).
2. The game will prompt you to enter a guess between 1 and 100.
3. After each guess, the game will provide feedback:
   - If your guess is higher than the random number, it will display "Too high!".
   - If your guess is lower than the random number, it will display "Too low!".
   - If your guess is correct, it will display "Correct! You got it in [number of tries] guesses!".
4. Keep guessing until you correctly guess the number.
